    <p>Hello Team 5522,</p>
    <p>
      Congratulations on completing the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) Event Registration process!</p>
    <p>
      Your team is registered to attend the Shenzhen Regional. This event will take place from March 08 to March 11, 2017 in Shenzhen City, 44 China. Details on all FRC competition events can be found here: urlRegionalEvents Click on the name of an event to find event information, a public schedule, and more.</p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      As you prepare for the start of the FRC season, there are a few things you should know:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type:decimal">
      <li>
        <p>
          Register for a Local Kickoff as soon as possible. Attending a local Kickoff will save your team the cost of shipping your Kit, plus give you a chance to meet other teams in your area while you learn about the new season's game. It's an experience you don't want to miss!</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        If you are not able to physically attend a Kickoff, you can select to ship the kit to your location for a fee. You must provide your exact delivery address in your Team Registration. For your convenience, FIRST is able to offer a negotiated flat- rate shipping service- payable directly in the Events section of your Team Registration account under “Mysite International Kit Ship”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Apply for a Robot Transportation Exemption. If your team is unable to transport the robot on their own, familiarize yourself with the criteria and fill out a request form located here: http://www.firstinspires.org/resource-library/frc/robot-transportation</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Hold strategy meetings, fundraise, give trainings, and plan your team calendar BEFORE the season starts. You won't have time to do anything but build after Kickoff. Make your travel arrangements, get permission from parents and the school, and have team members complete their consent and release forms now to save time later. These are required to attend Kickoff events.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Watch for team communications from FIRST throughout the season. Email blasts are sent to the Lead Coach/Mentor 1 and 2 and any team mentors registered in Team Registration System who choose to opt-in. The Lead Coach/Mentor 1 and 2 should share the information with the rest of the team.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Go get Team Updates. Team Updates are published weekly after Kickoff. Every year FRC creates a new, unique game. As teams design and build their robot, they may ask the Game Design Committee questions using the Q & A forum urlQas. Game changes are shared in Team Updates posted weekly during the season urlTeamUpdates. These updates are official and it is important your team keep up to date to save time and trouble at the competition.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Rookies can submit for awards. Information regarding the awards, as well as how to submit for the awards, can be found on the awards page: http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/awards</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Decide what components your team wants to order from FIRST Choice as soon as you can. Parts are limited and may sell out shortly after the site opens for business.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        As soon as it is released, download the encrypted FRC Game Manual: urlManual. The encryption code will be shown on screen during the Kickoff screening. You can then un-encrypt your manual on your computer and get right to work rather than trying to log onto a busy webpage and having to wait to download the un-encrypted version.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you have any questions, please send email to frcteams@firstinspires.org.</p>
    <p>
      Go Teams!</p>
